# make will look at the last-write dates of each file, and if the target
# file hasn't been updated since the source files were last modified,
# it will update the target file by executing the shell command. Note that
# the spacing to the < source files > and < compilation command > MUST be
# done with tabs, not spaces.

# now here is a Macro as defined in Glass Unix.

cc =		gcc -m32

explorit:		explore.o 
		$(cc) -g -lm -o explorit explore.o  

# note that if calc.h changes, main.c and getop.c must be recompiled

explore.o:	explore.c 
		$(cc) -g -c explore.c


# this tells make what to make if you just type 'make'; if this isn't there,
# the first rule in the file will be the default.


# here is a rule to clean up the directory when calcit is final and you want
# to reduce the clutter in the listing. Note that clean doesn't need to
# depend on any file modification time, so the < source files > position is
# just left empty.
